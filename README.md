The simplest documentation tool that could possibly work â€” with a little bit of
flexibility ;)

**type.writer** is a documentation tool that's based on
[@rstacruz's Flatdoc](http://ricostacruz.com/flatdoc/). In a sense, it works
like [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/), except that you don't have multiple
output formats, multiple configurations, multiple... Instead, you just dump
whatever markdown files you have in a folder and we'll generate the proper HTML
docs.


## Installing

Currently the best way to install type.writer is by hand:

 1.  Make sure you have a [Java JRE 7][JRE].
 2.  [Download the latest release][release]
 3.  Place `bin/typewriter` somewhere in your `$PATH`.

> **Note**: it only works on Linux right now (and **maybe** in OS/X).

[release]: https://github.com/kurisuwhyte/type.writer/releases/download/v0.2.0/typewriter-0.2.0.tar.gz


## Basic Usage

type.writer uses a simple project structure, which you can generate running:

    $ typewriter new
    
After that, put the relevant meta-data in the `project.edn` file, dump your
`*.md` markdown files in the `source/` folder and run:

    $ typewriter build
